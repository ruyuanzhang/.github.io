I am currently a postdoctal research associate in [Center for Magnetic Resonance Research][CMRR] at University of Minnesota at Twin cities.


I got my Ph.D in [Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences][BCS] and [Center of Visual Science][CVS] in  University of Rochester (Rochester,NY). I was working with Prof. [Daphne Bavelier] [Bavelier] and Prof. [Duje Tadin][Tadin]. Super lucky! Two smart and nice advisors help me a lot both in my life and academic career.


I was born in Zhanjiajie, a small city in south of China. It's famous for natural beauty. The memories with my parents and friends always make me homesick. In 2006, I entered in Peking University and majored in Psychology.  In 2007, Prof. [Fang Fang][Fang] offered me an research assistant position in his newly established lab. From then, I married to cognitive science. In 2010, I came to US to pursue my PhD study.
