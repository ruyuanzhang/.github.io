I am currently a postdoctal research associate in Center for Magnetic Resonance Research Center at University of Minnesota at Twin cities.


I got my Ph.D in Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Center of Visual Science in  University of Rochester (Rochester,NY). Now I am working with Prof. Daphne Bavelier and Prof. Duje Tadin. Super lucky! Two smart and nice advisors help me a lot both in my life and academic career.


I was born in Zhanjiajie, a small city in south of China. It's famous for natural beauty. The memories with my parents and friends always make me homesick. In 2006, I entered in Peking University and majored in Psychology.  In 2007, Prof. Fang Fang offered me an research assistant position in his newly established lab. From then, I married to cognitive science. In 2010, I came to US to pursue my PhD study.
