        <h3>Neuroimaging Method and Neuroinformatics</h3>
        <p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used in investigating complex structural and functional compositions of the human brain, as well as in various forms of diagnostic and rehabilitative practices. Rapid progress of neuroimaging techniques in the last couple of decades has produced a vast quantity of brain anatomical and functional data. It remains a key challenge for neuroscientists to efficiently infer substrates of human brain functions from massive datasets, and also for biomedical practicers to extract clinically meaningful information. Hence, developing novel data processing methods and pipelines is essential and fruitful for the next stage of neuroimaging research. We believe that bridging state-of-art machine learning methods and neuroimaging data will open new avenues for future data-driven neuroscience research and promote more accurate clinical decisions, as well as customized medical service for patients.</p>
