I am currently a postdoctoral research associate, working with Prof. Geoffery Ghose[Kay] in [Center for Magnetic Resonance Research][CMRR] at University of Minnesota Twin cities.


I got my Ph.D in 2016 from [Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences][BCS] and [Center for Visual Science][CVS] at  University of Rochester (Rochester,NY). During my Ph.D, I worked with Prof. [Daphne Bavelier] [Bavelier] and Prof. [Duje Tadin][Tadin]. Super lucky! Two smart and nice advisors helped me a lot both in my life and academic career.


I was born in Zhangjiajie, a small city in middle south of China. It's famous for natural beauty. The memories with my parents and friends always make me homesick. From 2006, I majored in psychology and minored in computer science at Peking University, China.  In 2007, Prof. [Fang Fang][Fang] offered me a research assistant position in his newly established lab. From then, I married to cognitive science. After my undergraduate study, I came to US to pursue my PhD study.
